# Surf-shop SQL Analysis

## Overview of Project


### Purpose


The purpose of this analysis was to understand the trends of weather in Hawaii before opening the surf shop. Main idea was to see the difference in temperature between June and December in Oahu. The opening question was will opening the surf and ice cream shop be sustainable in all year. 
 

## Results

- The mean temperature for June data was 74.94 whereas December data were 71, which shows that there is no big difference in terms of mean temperature
- The other code below show the frequency of temperature on June and December, the median for December was 70 whereas June was 75.
- Since the standard deviation for two data was around the same and there was no big difference in terms of temperature, investigating other factors that could signifantly affect the surfing and ice-cream shops were encouraged.


## Summary
### Other factors?
I decided precipitation as a factor that could affect the ice cream & surfing shop businesses thus I went over the summary statistics of precipitation data as well as frequency. The results showed that there was no big difference (December = 0.21, June = 0.13) between two months. As there is no huge difference in precipitation and temperature, It is encouraged to research about other factors, but if there is no such factor, W.Avy is encouraged to open the surf and ice-cream shop business year round.
